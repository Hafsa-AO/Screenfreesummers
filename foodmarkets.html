      <p>A fresh newcomer to the foodie scene, this halal market offers Middle Eastern and South Asian flavours in a family-friendly setting. Seek out vegan sweets, kids-platter options, and communal seating. While still new, it’s being praised for its inclusive, affordable vibe.</p>

      <h2>Great British Food Festival – Wimbledon Park</h2>
      <p>Coming to London for the first time in summer 2025, this festival includes free kids’ cookery demos, foraging walks, street food vendors and a mini zoo.
